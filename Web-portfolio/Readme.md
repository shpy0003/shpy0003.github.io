This assignment was really interesting and showed me what I have to work more in the future. I decided to use "Flex" to create a responsive website without using breakpoints. Unfortunately, This decision created a lot of obstacles on my way.

Firstly, the main problem was to put images in a specific position. Since I was using "Flex" It was almost impossible to put them accurately. I decided to just change the width of images to fit mockup.

Secondly, I wanted to make a hamburger menu but I failed. I was looking to guides but since I don't have experience working with Java-Script this idea was to disappear from project. ( I think this website has to be with this menu. It will make it more comfortable to use on tablet and mobile devices)

Overall, this website can be perfect if I put some additional pieces in it and learn more about Java/spacing.
